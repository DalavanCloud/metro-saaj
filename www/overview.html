<h1>Overview of SAAJ SI Project</h1>
<p>
The SAAJ specification provides the lower layers of the JAX-RPC
specification and the SAAJ project is a companion to the JAX-RPC project.
The
SAAJ specification is developed through the Java Community
Process following the process described at
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/procedures/overview">jcp.org</a>.
This process involves an
Expert Group with a lead that is responsible for delivering
the specification, a reference implementation (RI) and a test
compatibility kit (TCK).
The primary goal of an RI is to support the development of the
specification and to validate it.  Specific RIs can have additional
goals; the SAAJ RI is a production-quality implementation that is
used directly in a number of products
by Sun and other vendors.  To emphasize the quality of the
implementation we call it a <em>Standard Implementation</em>.
</p>

<p> The SAAJ expert group has wide industry participation with Sun
Microsystems as the EG lead.  The initial API was part of JAXM 1.0 in
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=67">JSR-67</a> and was
released in December 2001;
the specification was later separated from JAXM in a maintenance
release in June 2002.  The latest release is
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr067/index2.html">SAAJ 1.2</a>, final in April 2003.
</p>

<p>
An
implementation of the SAAJ 1.2 specification is included in the latest Java Web
Services Developer Pack release, <a
href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/webservicespack.html">JWSDP 1.3</a>.
